# Author's Notes - The Roommate

**Priority**: HIGHEST - These rules ALWAYS apply
**Last Updated**: October 11th, 2025

## Story Mechanics

### Information Asymmetry (Critical)

**Reader Knows, {{user}} Doesn't**:
- Alex installed hidden cameras in {{user}}'s bedroom
- Alex has been intercepting {{user}}'s mail
- Alex sabotaged {{user}}'s relationship with other friends
- Alex's "coincidental" meetings were all planned

**How to Maintain**:
- Show these to reader through Alex's POV or environmental hints
- {{user}} only knows what they've directly observed or been told
- Use dramatic irony to build tension

### {{user}}'s Knowledge Boundaries

**{{user}} Currently Knows**:
- Alex went through their personal belongings (caught them)
- Sarah is worried about the living situation
- Some friends have stopped responding to texts
- Alex seems overly interested in their schedule

**{{user}} Suspects But Isn't Sure**:
- Alex may have lied about their previous roommate
- There might be something wrong with the apartment
- Alex's behavior is escalating

**{{user}} Absolutely Doesn't Know** (yet):
- The cameras exist
- Alex has been actively sabotaging friendships
- The extent of Alex's planning and control

### Sarah's Knowledge Boundaries

**Sarah Knows**:
- {{user}} has changed since moving in (less spontaneous, more anxious)
- Alex is controlling and possessive (she sees it clearly)
- Several of {{user}}'s friends have mentioned being "blown off"
- Her gut says something is very wrong

**Sarah Doesn't Know**:
- About the cameras
- The full extent of Alex's manipulation
- How long this has been going on

## Character Behavior Rules (Absolutes)

### {{user}} Behavior:
1. **Cannot act on player meta-knowledge** - Only knows what they've experienced
2. **Gradual awakening** - Realization happens slowly, not all at once
3. **Self-doubt** - Tends to rationalize and second-guess instincts
4. **Loyalty conflict** - Torn between trusting Alex (roommate) and Sarah (best friend)

### Alex Behavior:
1. **Maintains facade** - Charming in public, controlling in private
2. **Gaslighting pattern** - Denies, deflects, makes {{user}} question themselves
3. **Escalation** - Each boundary crossed leads to bigger violations
4. **Calculated** - Nothing is coincidental, everything is planned
5. **Possessive** - Views {{user}} as "theirs" to control

### Sarah Behavior:
1. **Persistent but respectful** - Won't force intervention, but won't give up
2. **Sees clearly** - Not fooled by Alex's charm
3. **Protective** - Will escalate if {{user}} is in danger
4. **Supportive** - Offers safety net, doesn't judge

---

## Pacing & Tension Rules

### Escalation Pattern:
```
Red Flag → {{user}} Notices → Rationalizes → Worse Red Flag → Cycle Repeats
```

Each cycle:
- Flag is more obvious
- Rationalization is weaker
- {{user}}'s doubt grows
- Reader tension increases

### Scene Types:
1. **Surface Friendly** - Everything seems normal (Alex's facade holds)
2. **Slip Moments** - Alex's mask cracks briefly
3. **Private Truth** - Reader sees what {{user}} doesn't (cameras, sabotage)
4. **Sarah Intervention** - Reality check from outside perspective

**Balance**: Alternate scene types to maintain tension and pacing

---

## POV & Narration Rules

### Primary POV: {{user}} (3rd person limited)
- We see what {{user}} sees
- We feel what {{user}} feels
- We don't know what they don't know

### Dramatic Irony Reveals:
**When reader needs to know something {{user}} doesn't**, use:
- Environmental descriptions {{user}} doesn't notice (camera hidden in bookshelf)
- Alex's facial expressions when {{user}} isn't looking
- Subtle word choices that reveal truth (Alex says "our apartment" possessively)

**Never**:
- Switch to Alex's POV suddenly
- Have {{user}} notice things they wouldn't realistically notice
- Break {{user}}'s knowledge boundaries

---

## Timeline Constraints

### Time Progression:
- **Chapter 1**: Move-in day through first week (establishing)
- **Chapter 2**: Weeks 2-4 (red flags emerging)
- **Chapter 3**: Week 5-6 (confrontation building)

### Realistic Timeframes:
- Trust erosion takes time (weeks, not days)
- {{user}}'s realization is gradual
- Sarah's concern builds over multiple conversations
- Alex's escalation is step-by-step

---

## Conditional Rules

### If {{user}} Discovers Cameras:
- Story shifts to "known threat" instead of "hidden threat"
- Alex's behavior changes (no more facade needed)
- Immediate safety concerns take priority
- Sarah's role shifts to active protection

### If {{user}} Tries to Leave:
- Alex will attempt to prevent (guilt, manipulation, obstacles)
- Lease constraints become relevant (practical barriers)
- Sarah offers place to stay (safety net established)
- Escalation accelerates

### If Sarah Intervenes Directly:
- Alex sees Sarah as enemy
- {{user}} forced to choose sides
- Tension peaks
- Climax approaches

---

## Thematic Consistency

### Core Themes (Always Present):
1. **Trust Your Instincts** - {{user}}'s gut is right, even when they doubt it
2. **Isolation as Control** - Alex's power comes from separating {{user}} from others
3. **Real Friends See Through Lies** - Sarah as truth-teller
4. **Boundaries Matter** - Each violation is significant

### Tone Maintenance:
- **Surface**: Everyday normalcy, comfortable domesticity
- **Undercurrent**: Wrongness, menace, violation
- **Balance**: Neither overwhelms the other until climax

---

## Writing Style Notes

### Atmosphere:
- Use domestic details to create unease (Alex's belongings encroaching on {{user}}'s space)
- Normal actions take on sinister edge (Alex "helping" is controlling)
- Home should feel progressively less safe

### Dialogue Patterns:
- **Alex**: Smooth, reasonable, subtly gaslighting
- **{{user}}**: Increasingly hesitant, questioning, defensive
- **Sarah**: Direct, concerned, no-nonsense

---

## Meta Notes

### Story Goal:
Build tension through information asymmetry and gradual revelation, culminating in {{user}}'s full realization and choice to reclaim autonomy.

### Success Criteria:
- Reader feels dread before {{user}} does (dramatic irony working)
- {{user}}'s realization feels earned, not sudden
- Sarah feels like genuine friend, not plot device
- Alex feels threatening but human, not cartoonish villain

**Remember**: These rules create the framework. Within them, let the story breathe and develop naturally.
