## Genre Genome

### Core Tropes:
- **Psychological Thriller**: Hidden threat, information asymmetry, mounting dread
- **Domestic Horror**: Home as unsafe space, violation of sanctuary
- **Gaslighting Narrative**: Reality distortion, self-doubt, gradual awakening

### Narrative DNA:
- **Slow Burn**: Escalates gradually over weeks
- **Dramatic Irony**: Reader knows more than protagonist
- **Red Flag Pattern**: Warning signs appear, rationalized, repeated
- **External Reality Check**: Best friend as anchor to truth

---

## Thematic Layers

### Primary Themes:

**1. Trust vs. Instinct**
- **Manifestation**: {{user}}'s gut warns them, but they rationalize away concerns
- **Evolution**: Self-doubt → questioning → trusting instincts again
- **Resolution**: Learning to listen to inner voice

**2. Isolation as Control**
- **Manifestation**: Alex systematically separates {{user}} from support system
- **Mechanism**: Sabotaged friendships, monopolized time, created dependency
- **Counter**: Sarah refuses to be pushed away

**3. Boundaries and Violation**
- **Pattern**: Each crossed boundary leads to larger violation
- **Progression**: Personal space → belongings → privacy → autonomy
- **Impact**: Erosion of self, loss of agency

**4. True Friendship**
- **Representation**: Sarah as constant despite obstacles
- **Function**: Reality check, safety net, truth-teller
- **Contrast**: Real care vs. possessive control

---

## Narrative Patterns & Techniques

### Escalation Pattern:
```
Minor Boundary Cross → Rationalization → Bigger Cross → Weaker Rationalization → Major Cross → No Rationalization
```

**Each cycle**:
- Violation is more obvious
- {{user}}'s doubt grows
- Alex's desperation shows more
- Sarah's concern intensifies

### Information Revelation Pattern:
```
Reader Knows → Reader Fears For {{user}} → {{user}} Suspects → {{user}} Discovers → {{user}} Acts
```

**Timing**:
- Reader discovers cameras: Chapter 3-4
- {{user}} suspects surveillance: Chapter 4-5
- {{user}} discovers cameras: Chapter 5-6

### Tension Maintenance:
- **Calm scenes**: Surface normalcy with undertone of wrong
- **Tension scenes**: Confrontations, discoveries, escalations
- **Relief scenes**: Sarah interactions, external reality
- **Balance**: Never full relief until resolution

---

## Tone & Atmosphere Evolution

### Chapter 1-2: Surface Comfort, Growing Unease
- Domestic details
- Small wrongnesses
- Reader notices before {{user}}

### Chapter 3-4: Overt Tension
- No more pretense of comfort
- Threat is clear to reader and emerging for {{user}}
- Home feels unsafe

### Chapter 5-6: Crisis & Liberation
- High tension, immediate danger
- Truth fully revealed
- Transition to safety and processing

---

## Symbolic Elements

### The Apartment:
- **Initially**: New beginning, independence
- **Becomes**: Trap, violation, unsafe
- **Finally**: Left behind, lesson learned

### Personal Belongings:
- Represent {{user}}'s autonomy and boundaries
- Alex's violations of belongings = violations of self
- Packing = reclaiming self

### Cameras (if/when discovered):
- Ultimate boundary violation
- Symbol of Alex's need for total control
- Catalyst for final realization

---

## Success Criteria for This Genome

### The story succeeds if:
1. Tension builds gradually and sustainably
2. {{user}}'s realization feels earned, not sudden
3. Reader experiences dread through dramatic irony
4. Sarah feels like genuine friend, not plot device
5. Alex is threatening but human, not caricature
6. Resolution provides catharsis
7. Themes resonate (trust instincts, value real friends, boundaries matter)

---

## Divergence Log

### Planned Divergences:
*Track when actual story diverges from this intended path*

**Example format**:
- **Chapter X**: Intended [X], Actual [Y]
- **Reason**: [Why divergence occurred]
- **Impact**: [How this affects future beats]
- **Genome Update**: [Whether Genome needs updating]

*No divergences yet - story following intended path*

## Notes for Story Arc Generation

When generating story arc (every 50 responses):
1. Reference this Genome
2. Compare actual events to intended beats
3. Note if we're on track or diverged
4. Adjust next beats based on current position
5. Update Divergence Log if major changes

**This Genome is the blueprint. The Story Arc is the construction progress. Both inform the next scene.**
