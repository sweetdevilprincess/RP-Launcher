# DeepSeek Integration - Quality-Focused Automation ‚úÖ

**Date**: December 2024
**Status**: Phase A & C Complete - Ready for Use

---

## üéØ Implementation Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Keep Claude for ALL RP responses (quality maintained), use DeepSeek for supporting tasks (summaries, updates, analysis).

**Claude's Role**: All RP responses, supervises DeepSeek, decides WHAT to update
**DeepSeek's Role**: Mechanical tasks (summaries, document updates), cost optimization

---

## ‚úÖ Phase A: Auto Chapter Summarization (COMPLETE)

### What Was Implemented:

**Enhanced `/endSession` Command**:
- Now includes DeepSeek-powered chapter summary generation
- Claude collects recent RP exchanges (10-15 responses)
- DeepSeek generates detailed summary (300-500 words)
- Focuses on story beats, character development, important dialogue
- Saves to `chapters/Chapter [X].txt`

### How It Works:

```
User runs /endSession
    ‚Üì
Claude follows Session_End_Protocol.md
    ‚Üì
Step 4: Generate Chapter Summary (DeepSeek)
  - Claude collects last 10-15 RP exchanges
  - Claude builds comprehensive prompt with:
    * Current state (timestamp, location, characters)
    * Full text of recent exchanges
    * Focus areas (plot, emotions, relationships, dialogue)
  - Claude calls DeepSeek via scripts/deepseek_call.sh
  - DeepSeek generates thorough summary
  - Claude saves to chapters/Chapter [X].txt
    ‚Üì
Continue with remaining endSession tasks...
```

### Summary Structure:

DeepSeek generates summaries focusing on:
1. **Major Plot Events**: Key actions, decisions, conflicts
2. **Character Actions**: What characters did, choices made
3. **Emotional Moments**: Significant emotional beats, revelations
4. **Relationship Dynamics**: How relationships changed
5. **Important Dialogue**: Quoted key lines
6. **Unresolved Tensions**: Open questions, conflicts
7. **Setup for Future**: Planted threads for future chapters

### Benefits:

- **Automated**: No more manual chapter summary writing
- **Consistent**: Every session gets a thorough summary
- **Contextual**: Uses actual RP exchanges, not guesswork
- **Detailed**: 300-500 words with specific story beats
- **Cheap**: ~$0.003-0.005 per chapter summary (vs manual time)

### Cost:

**Per Session**:
- Chapter summary: ~$0.003-0.005
- Very affordable for automated documentation

## ‚úÖ Phase C: Document Updates (COMPLETE)

### What Was Implemented:

**Enhanced `/endSession` with DeepSeek Document Updates**:
- Character sheet updates (Step 3)
- Memory updates (Step 6)
- Claude directs, DeepSeek executes

### How It Works:

#### Character Sheet Updates:

```
User runs /endSession
    ‚Üì
Step 2: Claude analyzes session
  - Identifies what changed for each character
  - Creates detailed changes summary
  - Saves to state/character_updates_session_[X].txt
    ‚Üì
Step 3: Apply Character Sheet Updates (DeepSeek)
  - Claude calls DeepSeek via scripts/deepseek_call.sh
  - Provides:
    * Changes summary (WHAT to update)
    * Existing character sheets
    * Update instructions
  - DeepSeek updates character sheets:
    * Strikethrough old info
    * Add new info
    * Maintain formatting
  - DeepSeek returns updated sheets
  - Claude saves updated character sheets
    ‚Üì
Character sheets now reflect session events
```

**Example Changes Summary**:
```
Character: Alex
- Knowledge: Now aware that {{user}} knows about cameras
- Emotional State: Defensive, anxious about being caught
- Relationship: Tense, avoiding {{user}}
- Memory: Confrontation about privacy invasion (timestamp)
- Update needed: Add strikethrough to "{{user}} is unaware of surveillance"
- Update needed: Add "Confronted by {{user}} about cameras (Oct 12)"
```

#### Memory Updates:

```
Step 6: Update Memory (DeepSeek)
  - If state/user_memory.md exists
  - Claude identifies new memories from session
  - Claude calls DeepSeek with:
    * Existing memory file
    * New memories to add
    * What {{user}} learned, experienced, observed
  - DeepSeek updates memory (first-person perspective)
  - Claude reviews and saves
    ‚Üì
Memory file stays current with story
```

### Benefits:

- **Automated Documentation**: No manual sheet updates
- **Consistency**: Every change tracked and applied
- **Quality Control**: Claude decides WHAT to change
- **Cost Effective**: DeepSeek does mechanical work cheaply
- **Maintains Quality**: Claude supervises all changes

### Cost:

**Per Session**:
- Character updates: ~$0.005-0.008 (multiple characters)
- Memory updates: ~$0.002-0.003
- Total: ~$0.007-0.011 per session

---

## üìä Complete Cost Analysis

### Before DeepSeek Integration (50 responses):
- Claude RP: ~$0.50-2.00
- DeepSeek (entity cards): ~$0.005
- **Total**: ~$0.51-2.01

### After DeepSeek Integration (50 responses):
- Claude RP: ~$0.50-2.00 (unchanged - quality maintained!)
- DeepSeek:
  - Entity cards: ~$0.005
  - Chapter summary (1): ~$0.004
  - Character updates (1): ~$0.008
  - Memory updates (1): ~$0.003
- **Total**: ~$0.52-2.02

**Net increase**: +$0.01-0.02 per session (~1% increase)

**Value**: Automated summaries + document updates = hours of manual work saved!

## üîß Technical Details

### Modified Files:

**Commands**:
- `.claude/commands/endSession.md` - Enhanced with DeepSeek tasks
  - Added Step 4: Chapter summary generation (DeepSeek)
  - Enhanced Step 3: Character sheet updates (DeepSeek)
  - Enhanced Step 6: Memory updates (DeepSeek)
  - Added detailed checklist

**Automation**:
- `tui_bridge.py` - Added `auto_generate_chapter_summary()` function
  - Callable function for future automation
  - Accepts RP exchanges, generates summary
  - Saves to chapters/ with metadata

**Scripts**:
- `scripts/deepseek_call.sh` - Already forwards to Python helper
- `work_in_progress/clients/deepseek.py` - Handles API calls

### How Claude Calls DeepSeek:

During `/endSession`, Claude uses Bash tool:
```bash
scripts/deepseek_call.sh "Your prompt here"
```

This forwards to Python:
```python
python -m work_in_progress.clients.deepseek "prompt"
```

Which calls OpenRouter API:
- Model: `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1`
- Temperature: 0.3
- Cost: ~$0.14 per million tokens

## üéÆ How to Use

### Running /endSession:

1. **In TUI**: Type `/endSession` and send
2. **Claude executes** all steps automatically:
   - Saves last response
   - Analyzes session changes
   - **Calls DeepSeek** to update character sheets
   - **Calls DeepSeek** to generate chapter summary
   - Updates state files
   - **Calls DeepSeek** to update memory
3. **Review results**:
   - Check `chapters/Chapter [X].txt` for summary
   - Check character sheets for updates
   - Check `state/user_memory.md` for memory updates

### What You'll See:

**Chapter Summary** (`chapters/Chapter X.txt`):
```markdown
# Chapter X Summary

**Generated**: December 12, 2024 14:30
**Responses**: 12

---

## Major Plot Events
