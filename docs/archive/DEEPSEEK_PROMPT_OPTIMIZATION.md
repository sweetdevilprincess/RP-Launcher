# DeepSeek Prompt Optimization Plan

**Goal**: Reduce tokens sent to DeepSeek by 30-40% while improving output quality

## Principle

**Current inefficient flow**:
```
Claude formats for humans → DeepSeek reads human text → DeepSeek formats for humans
```

**Optimized flow**:
```
Claude extracts to compact format → DeepSeek reads compact data → DeepSeek formats for humans
```

## Benefits
1. **30-40% fewer tokens** sent to DeepSeek
2. **Easier parsing** for DeepSeek (structured data)
3. **Better output** (DeepSeek focuses on formatting, not parsing)
4. **Lower cost** (~$0.006 saved per session)

## 1. Entity Card Generation (Hook + /gencard)

### Current Approach
```
Create an entity card for a roleplay story.

Entity Name: Marcus
Mentions: 8

Context from story:
Marcus appeared in Chapter 2. He was {{user}}'s friend. They had
a conversation about moving in with Silas. Marcus seemed concerned.
He texted {{user}} a warning. Marcus tried to intervene later...
[200-300 tokens of narrative prose]
```

### Optimized Approach
```json
{
  "entity": "Marcus",
  "type": "character",
  "mentions": 8,
  "first_chapter": 2,
  "context": [
    {"ch": 2, "event": "Appeared as {{user}}'s friend, concerned about Silas"},
    {"ch": 2, "event": "Had conversation warning {{user}} about moving in"},
    {"ch": 3, "event": "Texted warning, {{user}} defensive"},
    {"ch": 5, "event": "Planned intervention"}
  ],
  "relationships": ["{{user}}: close friend, protective"],
  "traits": ["concerned", "protective", "observant"]
}

Task: Generate entity card in markdown format with:
- [CHAR] prefix
- Triggers (name + variations)
- Description (expand from traits)
- Role (expand from context)
- Significance (deduce from events)
- Appearances (expand from context array)
```

**Token savings**: ~40% (100-120 tokens vs 200-300)

---

## 2. Memory Updates (Hook + /memory + /endSession)

### Current Approach
```
Update character memory for {{user}}.

Current Memory State:
[Full 500-800 token formatted memory file]

Recent Events (from last few responses):
{{user}} moved in with Silas. She felt nervous but excited. Gabriel
the cat was terrified and wouldn't eat. {{user}} noticed red flags
but rationalized them. Marcus sent a warning text...
[300-400 tokens of narrative prose]
```

### Optimized Approach
```json
{
  "current_memory": {
    "immediate": ["Event 1", "Event 2", "Event 3"],
    "recent": ["Event A summary", "Event B summary"],
    "significant": [{"event": "Discovery X", "ch": 5, "why": "turning point"}],
    "past": ["General knowledge Y"]
  },
  "new_events": [
    {"ts": "Nov 5, 7:20 PM", "event": "Moved in with Silas", "sig": "high"},
    {"ts": "Nov 5, 8:00 PM", "event": "Gabriel terrified", "sig": "medium"},
    {"ts": "Nov 5, 8:30 PM", "event": "Marcus warned via text", "sig": "high"},
    {"ts": "Nov 5, 9:00 PM", "event": "Rationalized red flags", "sig": "medium"}
  ]
}

Task: Generate updated memory file in markdown format:
- Move immediate → recent (summarize)
- Add new_events to immediate (expand with vivid detail)
- Promote high-sig events to significant if warranted
- Maintain character perspective
```

**Token savings**: ~35% (400-500 tokens vs 600-800)

---

## 3. Chapter Summary (/endSession)

### Current Approach
```
Create comprehensive chapter summary (2,500-3,000 words).

Session Chatlog:
[Saturday, November 5th, 2024 - 7:20 PM, Bruno's Italian Restaurant]

{{user}}: I took a deep breath and looked at Silas across the
candlelit table. "I've been thinking about what you said..."

Silas: He leaned forward, eyes intense. "About moving in?" His hand
reached across the table to cover mine. "I want you to know..."

---

[Saturday, November 5th, 2024 - 7:45 PM, Bruno's Italian Restaurant]

{{user}}: My phone buzzed. Marcus's name flashed on the screen. I
glanced at it nervously...

[Continues for 2,000-3,000 tokens of full dialogue/action]
```

### Optimized Approach
```json
{
  "session_data": {
    "chapter": 5,
    "date_range": "Nov 5, 2024",
    "locations": ["Bruno's Italian Restaurant", "Silas's Apartment"],
    "exchanges": [
      {
        "ts": "7:20 PM, Restaurant",
        "u": "Deep breath, looked at Silas, discussed moving in concerns",
        "c": "Leaned forward intense, reached for hand, wants her there",
        "key": ["moving in discussion", "physical intimacy"]
      },
      {
        "ts": "7:45 PM, Restaurant",
        "u": "Phone buzz Marcus, glanced nervously, ignored",
        "c": "Noticed hesitation, asked if everything okay",
        "key": ["Marcus warning", "user dismissive"]
      },
      {
        "ts": "8:30 PM, Apartment",
        "u": "Agreed to move in, felt nervous but excited",
        "c": "Excited, already planning her space, possessive hints",
        "key": ["decision made", "red flags emerging"],
        "quote_u": "I want this. I want us.",
        "quote_c": "You won't regret this. I'll take such good care of you."
      }
    ],
    "key_developments": [
      "User agreed to move in (major decision)",
      "Marcus sent warning text (user dismissed)",
      "Silas showing subtle possessive signs",
      "User rationalizing despite gut feelings"
    ]
  }
}

Task: Generate 2,500-3,000 word chapter summary using template:
- Narrative prose from exchanges (expand compressed events)
- Include direct quotes where provided
- Character Developments section (deduce from key developments)
- Relationship Tracking (analyze dynamic shifts)
- Quote Preservation (use provided quotes + infer others)
- Timeline Documentation (expand from ts data)
- Theme Tracking (deduce from patterns)
```

**Token savings**: ~50% (1,000-1,500 tokens vs 2,000-3,000)
**Better output**: DeepSeek gets structured data, focuses on prose quality not parsing

---

## 4. Character Sheet Updates (/endSession)

### Current Approach
```
Update this character sheet based on session changes.

Character Updates:
## {{user}}

### Living Situation
~~Lives at apartment (428 Oak Street)~~ → Lives with Silas at his apartment

### Physical State
No change

### Emotional State
~~Hopeful and excited~~ → Anxious but rationalizing, cognitive dissonance

[Full prose descriptions: 300-400 tokens]

Current Character Sheet:
# {{user}}
...
[Full 800-1000 token character sheet]
```

### Optimized Approach
```json
{
  "character": "{{user}}",
  "changes": {
    "living": {"old": "428 Oak St apt", "new": "Silas's apartment (15th floor)"},
    "emotional": {"old": "hopeful, excited", "new": "anxious, rationalizing, cognitive dissonance"},
    "knowledge_new": ["Silas follows routine closely", "Gabriel terrified", "Marcus planning intervention"],
    "knowledge_suspects": ["Silas watching more than admitted", "Marcus + Jenna coordinated"],
    "relationships": {
      "Silas": {"change": "dating → living together", "trust": "slightly shaken but dismissed"},
      "Marcus": {"change": "close → pulling away", "dynamic": "defensive against warnings"}
    },
    "possessions_moved": ["All belongings", "Gabriel (cat)"],
    "resources_lost": ["Independence/escape route (lease ended)"]
  },
  "current_sheet": "[Paste current sheet]"
}

Task: Apply changes to character sheet in markdown:
- Use ~~strikethrough~~ for old info
- Add new info below
- Preserve unchanged sections
- Update "Last Updated" timestamp
```

**Token savings**: ~40% (600-700 tokens vs 1,000-1,200)

## 5. Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Update /endSession Command
- Rewrite to extract compact structured data
- Update all DeepSeek prompts to use JSON format
- **Files to modify**:
  - `.claude/commands/endSession.md`

### Phase 2: Update Hook
- Modify `auto_generate_entity_card()` for compact extraction
- **Files to modify**:
  - `.claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.sh`

### Phase 3: Update Manual Commands
- `/gencard` - compact entity context
- `/memory` - compact event list
- **Files to modify**:
  - `.claude/commands/gencard.md`
  - `.claude/commands/memory.md`

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Update AUTOMATION_CONFIG_README with new token counts
- Update NEW_FEATURES_SUMMARY with savings

---

## Expected Savings

### Per 50-Response Session:
**Before optimization**:
- Entity cards: 3 × 250 tokens avg = 750 tokens
- Memory updates: 3 × 700 tokens avg = 2,100 tokens
- endSession: ~3,500 tokens
- **Total input**: ~6,350 tokens = ~$0.0009

**After optimization**:
- Entity cards: 3 × 150 tokens avg = 450 tokens (40% savings)
- Memory updates: 3 × 450 tokens avg = 1,350 tokens (35% savings)
- endSession: ~1,800 tokens (48% savings)
- **Total input**: ~3,600 tokens = ~$0.0005

**Savings**: ~$0.0004 per session (~44% reduction)

Over 100 sessions: **$0.04 saved** (meaningful for frequent users!)

Plus: **Better quality output** from DeepSeek since it focuses on formatting, not parsing.
