## Changed

### Minimal Template Pack Optimization

**`setup/templates/starter_packs/minimal/` - Removed Auto-Generated State Files**

Removed all auto-generated state files from template since `initialize_rp.py` generates them fresh from `StateTemplates` class:

**Removed**:
- `state/automation_config.json`
- `state/current_state.md`
- `state/entity_tracker.json`
- `state/file_tracking.json`
- `state/plot_threads_master.md`
- `state/response_counter.json`

**Rationale**: Template should contain only user-editable files. State files are generated programmatically on initialization, not copied from template. Single source of truth for state file structure is in code.

**Result**: Template reduced from ~15KB to ~8KB

**Setup Flow Clarified**:
1. `quick_setup.py` calls `RPInitializer.initialize()` → generates state files from `StateTemplates`
2. Then `copy_template()` copies user-editable files → no conflicts or overwrites

### AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md (Enhanced)

**New Sections Added**:
- Agent System Behavior & Integration
  - Result Caching explanation
  - Write Queue Integration details
  - Timeout & Error Handling specifics
  - Agent Priority System
  - Agent Configuration format
  - Execution Guarantees

**Clarifications Added**:
- How agent results flow through system
- 500ms debouncing behavior of FSWriteQueue
- What happens when agents fail
- Background agent execution order
- How new agents must be registered

### SUPPORTING_COMPONENTS.md (Expanded)

**New Components Documented**:
- Status Manager (src/automation/status.py)
  - CURRENT_STATUS.md generation
  - Template fields and purpose
  - Output format

- Time Tracker (src/automation/time_tracking.py)
  - In-world time calculation
  - Activity-based timing
  - Timeline consistency

### DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (Updated)

**Enhancements**:
- Added RP_DIRECTORY_MAP.md as documentation entry #8
- Updated "I want to... Fix File Read/Write Issues" task to reference RP_DIRECTORY_MAP.md first
- Added 4 new entries to QUICK LOOKUP TABLE for RP directory mapping and file interactions
- Updated FILE ORGANIZATION REFERENCE to include RP_DIRECTORY_MAP.md

**New - Launcher Documentation Addition**:
- Added LAUNCHER_DOCUMENTATION.md as documentation entry #9 (NEW)
- Updated "I want to..." sections with launcher-related tasks
- Added 5 new entries to QUICK LOOKUP TABLE:
  - How to use the launcher → LAUNCHER_DOCUMENTATION.md
  - What each F-key does → LAUNCHER_DOCUMENTATION.md#f-key-commands
  - Launcher troubleshooting → LAUNCHER_DOCUMENTATION.md#troubleshooting
  - Launcher architecture → LAUNCHER_DOCUMENTATION.md#architecture
  - Launcher configuration → LAUNCHER_DOCUMENTATION.md#configuration
- Updated FILE ORGANIZATION REFERENCE in root documentation list

### COMPONENT_DATA_FLOW.md (Updated)

**Enhancements**:
- Added note directing readers to RP_DIRECTORY_MAP.md for comprehensive RP directory file interactions
- Links to RP_DIRECTORY_MAP.md for detailed file operation debugging

### SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md (Updated)

**Enhancements**:
- Added reference note in FILE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM section
- Links to RP_DIRECTORY_MAP.md for detailed RP file structure and component interactions

### setup/README.md (Updated - Clarified Template vs. Auto-Generation)

**Changes**:
- Updated "What You Get" section (lines 149-180)
  - Split into "Files You Edit" vs "Files That Auto-Generate"
  - Clarified state files are created by `initialize_rp.py`
- Updated "Template Contents" section (lines 125-132)
  - Removed "All required state files" mention
  - Added note about auto-generation on first run
- Updated "Do I need to fill out every template?" Q&A (lines 189-194)
  - Listed truly required files
  - Added: "State files auto-generate on first run - you don't need to create them!"

### setup/CHECKLIST.md (Updated - Clarified Required vs. Auto-Generated)

**Changes**:
- Lines 52-56: Consolidated auto-generated state files into single note
  - Added ⚠️ warning that files auto-generate
  - Redirected to RP_DIRECTORY_MAP.md for reference
- Lines 58-70: Created "Core Story Files (Required for automation)" section
  - Documented TIER_1 loading requirement
  - Listed 4 essential story files
- Lines 67-70: Created "Truly Optional" section
  - Separated truly optional items from required files

### CLAUDE.md (Added Working Session Protocol)

**New Section Added**: "CLAUDE CODE WORKING SESSION PROTOCOL" (lines 295-396)

Critical protocol addressing context management during active working sessions:

**Session Initialization Requirements**:
- IMMEDIATELY read CLAUDE.md at start of every session
- Read project-specific CLAUDE.md files
- Check for session state files
- Load TodoWrite list
- DO NOT proceed without these

**Critical Information to Preserve (High/Medium/Sacrifice priorities)**:
- High: Current task, CLAUDE.md instructions, file paths, decisions, TIER_1 files, todo status
- Medium: Code snippets, error findings, documentation references
- Can sacrifice: Early exploratory searches, redundant explanations, verbose output

**Proactive Context Management**:
- Signal context concerns every ~30 messages
- Never assume `/compact` will work
- Create hand-offs between message groups
- Reference documentation instead of carrying all context

**Context Overflow Handling**:
- Create session summary (completed, in progress, pending tasks)
- Update project files with current state
- Ask user to start new session with explicit continuation context

**Prevents**: Context loss, missed critical information mid-task, forgotten project requirements

**Added**: SESSION CONTEXT section at end of CLAUDE.md for tracking current working session

- **Setup Documentation**: Clarified what users provide vs. what system generates
- **File Organization**: State directory structure now clearly explained
- **Inheritance Ready**: Minimal template serves as perfect base for genre-specific templates

### General Documentation

- **Code Documentation Standards**: Clear guidelines for docstrings, type hints, error handling
- **Navigation**: DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md provides task-based entry points
- **Cross-References**: All documents link to related sections
- **Quick References**: Tables and checklists for rapid lookup
