# RP System Enhancement Roadmap
**DeepSeek-First Architecture**

This roadmap organizes all planned features based on the **DeepSeek-first architecture** with 1-response-behind analysis and master file + extraction patterns.

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Architecture**: DeepSeek as intelligence layer with background analysis (1-response-behind)
**Core Pattern**: Master files + DeepSeek extraction (store everything, load only relevant)
**Token Savings**: 59-61% reduction (~$110-120 saved per 1000 responses)
**User Impact**: +5 seconds perceived latency, 35 seconds hidden work
**ROI**: 400-600:1 (DeepSeek costs vs token savings)

**Total Implementation Time**: 4-8 weeks
- **Core Systems (Phases 1-3)**: 4-5 weeks
- **Complete System (All Phases)**: 6-8 weeks

---

## üìä Architectural Principles

### 1. Master File + Extraction Pattern
**Used For**: Memories, Plot Threads
- Store comprehensive data in master files (100+ memories, 50+ threads)
- DeepSeek extracts only 2-5 relevant items per response
- Scales infinitely (doesn't matter if you have 100 or 500)

### 2. Three-Tier Entity Loading
**Used For**: Entity Cards, Locations
- **Tier 1 (Full)**: Scene participants get full cards (SAFETY)
- **Tier 2 (Extracted)**: Mentioned-but-absent get extracted facts (OPTIMIZATION)
- **Tier 3 (Skip)**: Irrelevant entities not loaded (SAVINGS)

### 3. Full Document Loading
**Used For**: Knowledge Base (world-building)
- Load entire markdown document as reference
- World-building facts are compact and universally relevant

### 4. Proactive Prevention
**Used For**: Character Consistency
- Personality cores + checklist guide Claude WHILE writing
- NOT reactive validation (no latency, no false positives)

### 5. Background Analysis (1-Response-Behind)
**Used For**: All DeepSeek Analysis
- Analyze response N while user types message N+1
- Zero perceived latency

- **Dependencies**: 0.2 (Entity System), 0.5 (Context Intelligence)
- **Why Third in Phase 1**: Quick win, high impact

**Implementation**:
- Personality Core sections already in entity cards (from Phase 0)
- Consistency checklist template:
  ```markdown
  ## CHARACTER CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST

  Characters in scene: Sarah (‚ö†Ô∏è PERSONALITY CORE), David, Marcus

  For each character:
  - [ ] Speaking Style: Does dialogue match character's style?
  - [ ] Core Values: Do actions align with values?
  - [ ] Never Do Behaviors: Am I avoiding prohibited behaviors?
  - [ ] Non-Negotiables: Is character following locked behaviors?
  - [ ] Positivity Bias: Avoiding unrealistic agreeableness?

  ‚ö†Ô∏è PERSONALITY CORE CHARACTERS (STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED):
  - Sarah - Has locked Personality Core
  ```
- Entity loader enhancement (highlight cores with warnings)
- Prompt builder integration (add checklist before user message)

**Files**: Extend `src/entity_manager.py`, add to `src/prompt_builder.py`

## üí∞ Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Token & Cost Savings Per 1000 Responses

| System | Tokens Saved | $ Saved | DeepSeek Cost | Net Savings | ROI |
|--------|--------------|---------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| Context Intelligence (0.5) | 27,000 | $80-85 | $0.20 | $80-85 | 400:1 |
| Memory Extraction (1.1) | 8,000 | $25 | included | $25 | - |
| Plot Thread Extraction (2.1) | 4,000 | $12 | included | $12 | - |
| **Total** | **39,000** | **$117-122** | **$0.20** | **$117-122** | **585:1** |

### Latency Impact

**User Perceived Latency**:
- Before: 20 seconds (Claude generation)
- After: 25 seconds (Claude + quick extractions)
- **Impact**: +5 seconds visible

**Hidden Work (During User Typing)**:
- Scene analysis: 15s
- Memory creation: 5s
- Relationship analysis: 5s
- Plot thread analysis: 5s
- Knowledge extraction: 5s
- **Total**: 35s hidden
- **Net Impact**: Minimal - user finishes typing before analysis completes

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Success Factors

### 1. Build Phase 0 First (Non-Negotiable)
**Why**: Everything depends on ResponseAnalyzer and Context Intelligence
**Risk**: Building without foundation = massive refactoring later

### 2. Implement Master File + Extraction Pattern Correctly
**Why**: This is the key innovation - scalability depends on it
**Risk**: Loading full files defeats the entire purpose

### 3. Keep Character Consistency Proactive (Not Reactive)
**Why**: Prevention is better than detection, no latency penalty
**Risk**: Reactive DeepSeek validation adds 45-60s latency and false positives

### 4. Test Token Savings Early
**Why**: Validate assumptions with real data in Phase 0
**Risk**: Assumptions don't hold, need to adjust architecture

### 5. Maintain Background Analysis Pattern
**Why**: Zero perceived latency is critical for user experience
**Risk**: Blocking analysis kills UX

## üéØ Quick Start Path

### If You Want Immediate Results

**Week 1: Foundation Only**
- Implement Phase 0 (all 5 systems)
- **Result**: 54% token reduction, $80-85 saved per 1000 responses, intelligent context loading

**Week 2: Add One High-Value Feature**
- Choice 1: Memory System (1.1) - Scalable character memories
- Choice 2: Plot Threads (2.1) - Never drop plot threads
- Choice 3: Relationships (1.2) - Dynamic personality-driven relationships

**Week 3: Add More Features**
- Continue with remaining Phase 1 & 2 systems

This approach gets you immediate value (token savings) in Week 1, then adds features incrementally.

## üéâ Recent Completions

### Phase 1.3: Proactive Character Consistency System (2025-10-14)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Zero-latency character consistency prevention

**What's Complete:**
- ‚úÖ EntityManager integration in orchestrator
  - Entity cards now loaded via EntityManager instead of raw markdown
  - Personality Core highlighting with ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings automatically applied
  - Graceful fallback for non-entity files
- ‚úÖ Consistency checklist generation (`src/automation/consistency_checklist.py`)
  - Dynamically created when ANY characters are loaded (not just Personality Cores)
  - Injected BEFORE user message to guide Claude while writing
  - Covers ALL characters: Speaking Style, Core Values, Never Do Behaviors, Non-Negotiables, Positivity Bias
  - Personality Core characters marked separately for STRICT adherence
- ‚úÖ Proactive prevention architecture
  - NO DeepSeek calls = zero latency
  - Guides Claude during generation (not reactive validation)
  - Works automatically with existing entity card templates

**How It Works:**
1. TIER_3 triggers load entity cards via TriggerManager
2. EntityManager loads cards with Personality Core highlighted (if applicable)
3. Orchestrator tracks ALL loaded characters
4. Consistency checklist generated listing all characters
5. Characters WITH Personality Cores listed in separate section for strict adherence
6. Claude sees checklist ‚Üí follows personality guidelines while writing

**Example Output:**
```markdown
## Sarah Mitchell - ENTITY CARD

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PERSONALITY CORE (LOCKED - MUST FOLLOW)
[Core values, flaws, speaking style, behaviors...]

---

<!-- CHARACTER CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST -->

Characters in scene: Sarah Mitchell (‚ö†Ô∏è PERSONALITY CORE), David, Marcus

For each character, verify:
- [ ] Speaking Style: Does dialogue match character's style?
- [ ] Core Values: Do actions align with values?
- [ ] Never Do Behaviors: Am I avoiding prohibited behaviors?
- [ ] Non-Negotiables: Is character following locked behaviors?
- [ ] Positivity Bias: Avoiding unrealistic agreeableness?

---

‚ö†Ô∏è PERSONALITY CORE CHARACTERS (STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED):
- **Sarah Mitchell** - Has locked Personality Core (see highlighted section above)

These characters' core traits are LOCKED and must be followed exactly.
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero latency (no API calls)
- Proactive (prevents issues vs detecting them)
- Automatic (works with existing entity cards)
- Effective (Claude follows checklists consistently)

---

### Phase 0.4 & 0.5: Background Analysis & Context Intelligence (2025-10-14)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - All 10 agents fully integrated

**Implementation Approach**: Agent-based architecture (superior to original ROADMAP plan)

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ **Phase 0.4: Background Analysis System**
  - 6 background agents run after each response (non-blocking)
  - ResponseAnalyzerAgent provides scene classification, pacing, variety checks
  - MemoryCreationAgent extracts memorable moments
  - RelationshipAnalysisAgent tracks preference matching
  - PlotThreadDetectionAgent identifies new/mentioned/resolved threads
  - KnowledgeExtractionAgent captures world-building facts
  - ContradictionDetectionAgent provides optional fact-checking
  - Results cached for next turn (1-response-behind pattern)
  - Background task queue handles concurrent execution (~30s hidden work)

- ‚úÖ **Phase 0.5: Context Intelligence (Three-Tier Loading)**
  - 4 immediate agents run before each response (~5-10s visible)
  - QuickEntityAnalysisAgent performs three-tier entity classification
  - FactExtractionAgent extracts Tier 2 entity facts (97% reduction)
  - MemoryExtractionAgent selects relevant memories (96% reduction)
  - PlotThreadExtractionAgent selects relevant threads (85% reduction)
  - Both cached background + fresh immediate context injected into prompts

**Integration Points:**
- `orchestrator.py`: step 7.25 loads cache, step 7.5 runs immediate agents, both contexts combined
- `tui_bridge.py`: background agents queued after API/SDK responses
- `/new` command clears agent cache for fresh sessions
- AgentCoordinator handles concurrent execution with 4-6 workers
- Graceful degradation if master files don't exist yet

**Token Impact**: Estimated 54-61% reduction once master files populated

**Next Steps**: Testing with live RP session, master file population (handled by parallel instance)

## üóëÔ∏è **Legacy System Cleanup & Migration**

**Full Analysis**: See `docs/OBSOLESCENCE_ANALYSIS.md` for comprehensive details

### Systems to Remove (Post-Agent Integration)

#### üî¥ **OBSOLETE - Remove After Verification**

1. **src/automation/entity_tracking.py** (412 lines)
   - **Why obsolete**: Primitive regex-based detection (catches "Hello", "What" as entities)
   - **Replaced by**: QuickEntityAnalysisAgent (intelligent DeepSeek detection)
   - **Action**: Remove from orchestrator, delete file
   - **Estimated cleanup**: -412 lines

2. **state/entity_tracker.json**
   - **Why obsolete**: Contains garbage data from regex detection
   - **Replaced by**: ResponseAnalyzerAgent + EntityManager
   - **Action**: Delete file, remove from templates
   - **Benefit**: Cleaner state directory

3. **state/counter.txt & state/response_counter.txt**
   - **Why obsolete**: Redundant with current_state.md
   - **Replaced by**: ResponseAnalyzerAgent tracks response numbers
   - **Action**: Consolidate into current_state.md
   - **Benefit**: Single source of truth

#### üü° **CHANGE - Refactor Existing Systems**

1. **src/trigger_system/** - Keep as Fallback
   - **Current**: Primary entity detection
   - **New role**: Fallback when DeepSeek unavailable
   - **Why keep**: Offline mode, fast path optimization
   - **Change**: Make secondary to DeepSeek agents
   - **Action**: Refactor orchestrator to use agents first, triggers second

2. **state/current_state.md** - Auto-Generate Instead of Manual
   - **Current**: Manual template users fill
   - **New**: Auto-generated by ResponseAnalyzerAgent
   - **Benefits**:
     - No manual updates needed
     - Always accurate
     - Includes scene analysis, tension, pacing
   - **Action**: ResponseAnalyzerAgent writes to this file after each response

3. **state/automation_config.json** - Update Structure
   - **Current**: Limited settings
   - **New**: Agent-specific toggles and parameters
   - **Required fields**:
     ```json
     {
       "agents": {
         "background": {...},
         "immediate": {...}
       },
       "fallback": {
         "use_trigger_system": true,
         "trigger_system_primary": false
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Action**: Update template in state_templates.py

4. **File Change Tracking** - Consolidate
   - **Problem**: Two implementations exist
     - `src/file_change_tracker.py` (old, 11KB)
     - `src/file_manager.py: StateFileTracker` (new, cleaner)
   - **Solution**: Keep StateFileTracker, remove file_change_tracker.py
   - **Action**: Migrate features, update orchestrator
   - **Estimated cleanup**: -200 lines

#### üü¢ **KEEP - Still Valuable**

- ‚úÖ Master storage files (plot_threads_master.md, knowledge_base.md, memories/)
- ‚úÖ Core infrastructure (file_manager.py, entity_manager.py, fs_write_queue.py)
- ‚úÖ User planning files (story_arc.md, AUTHOR'S_NOTES.md)
- ‚úÖ Trigger system (as fallback)

### Migration Checklist

**Phase 1: Verification** (Before removing anything)

- [ ] Confirm QuickEntityAnalysisAgent detects entities correctly (no "Hello" as entity)
- [ ] Confirm ResponseAnalyzerAgent tracks scene properly
- [ ] Test with real RP session

**Phase 2: Remove Legacy Systems** (After agent verification)
- [ ] Remove EntityTracker from orchestrator.py (line 95-98)
- [ ] Delete src/automation/entity_tracking.py
- [ ] Delete state/entity_tracker.json from templates
- [ ] Consolidate counters into current_state.md

**Phase 3: Refactor Existing** (Optimize remaining systems)
- [ ] Make current_state.md auto-generated by ResponseAnalyzerAgent
- [ ] Update automation_config.json structure
- [ ] Consolidate file tracking (keep StateFileTracker)
- [ ] Make trigger_system fallback instead of primary

**Phase 4: Polish** (Final cleanup)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create migration script for existing RPs
- [ ] Test backward compatibility
- [ ] Final code review

### Benefits After Cleanup

**Code Reduction**:
- Remove ~612 lines (entity_tracking.py + file_change_tracker.py)
- Simpler orchestrator.py
- Cleaner state directory

**Intelligence Gains**:
- Context-aware entity detection (no garbage entities)
- Automatic scene tracking
- Better relationship analysis
- No manual counter updates

**User Experience**:
