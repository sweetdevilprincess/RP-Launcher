**STORY GENOME REGENERATION**

Use this command when the story has diverged significantly from the original STORY_GENOME.md and you want to create a new genome that reflects the actual story direction.

---

## When to Use

- Story has taken unexpected turns due to organic character choices
- Major plot divergence from original intended path
- Want to realign future planning with actual story trajectory
- Need to document the new intended direction

---

## Process

### Step 1: Backup Original Genome

1. Read current `STORY_GENOME.md`
2. Save backup copy to `STORY_GENOME_backup_[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
3. Preserve original for reference

### Step 2: Analyze Current Story State

Read and analyze:
- Last 3-5 chapter summaries from `chapters/` folder
- Current `state/story_arc.md`
- Current `state/current_state.md`
- All character sheets from `characters/` folder

### Step 3: Compare Intended vs. Actual

**Document Divergences**:
- What was originally planned?
- What actually happened?
- Why did it diverge? (character agency, organic choices, better story beats)
- Which elements are still relevant?
- Which need complete revision?

### Step 4: Generate New Genome

Create updated STORY_GENOME.md that:

**Preserves**:
- Core premise (if still accurate)
- Character essences (if still accurate)
- World rules and setting
- Any plot beats still ahead

**Updates**:
- Intended story arc to reflect actual trajectory
- Character goals and motivations (current reality)
- Relationship dynamics (current state)
- Plot beats going forward (realistic next steps)
- Themes (as they've actually emerged)

**Format**:
```markdown
# [Story Title] - Story Genome

**Last Updated**: [Date]
**Original Version**: See STORY_GENOME_backup_[date].md
**Divergence Note**: [Brief note on major changes from original]

---

## Core Premise
[Updated if needed, or original if still accurate]

## Genre & Tone
[Actual tone as emerged, not just intended]

## Themes
[Themes as they've actually manifested in story]

## Character Arcs

### {{user}}
**Current State**: [Where they actually are]
**Intended Progression**: [Where story should go from here]
**Key Beats Ahead**:
1. [Realistic next beat]
2. [Realistic next beat]
...

### [Character]
**Current State**: [Reality]
**Intended Progression**: [From here forward]
**Key Beats Ahead**: [Realistic progression]

[Continue for each major character]

## Story Arc

### Act [Current]
**Status**: [Where we are in this act]
**Remaining Beats**:
- [Beat]: [Description]
- [Beat]: [Description]

### Act [Next]
**Intended Direction**: [Realistic next act]
**Key Beats**:
- [Beat]: [Description]
...

## Relationship Trajectories
[Current state → Intended progression for each major relationship]

## World Development
[Elements that have been established, elements planned]

## Open Questions
[Unresolved plot threads that need resolution]

## Pacing Notes
[Realistic pacing based on actual story tempo]

---

## Divergence Summary
*Document what changed and why - for future reference*

**Major Divergences from Original**:
1. [Divergence]: [Why it happened, why it works better]
2. [Divergence]: [Explanation]

**Abandoned Plot Threads**:
- [Thread]: [Why it no longer fits]

**New Plot Threads**:
- [Thread]: [How it emerged organically]
```

### Step 5: Save Updated Genome

1. Write new content to `STORY_GENOME.md`
2. Verify backup was created
3. Update `state/story_arc.md` to align with new genome

---

## Output Format

```
✅ Story Genome Updated

**Backup Created**:
- STORY_GENOME_backup_[date].md (original preserved)

**Updated Files**:
- STORY_GENOME.md (new version reflecting actual story)
- state/story_arc.md (aligned with new genome)

**Major Changes Documented**:
1. [Change summary]
2. [Change summary]
3. [Change summary]

**Current Story Arc**:
Currently in Act [X], [brief description]

**Next Intended Beats**:
1. [Next beat]
2. [Next beat]
3. [Next beat]

The story genome now reflects the actual story trajectory and provides realistic guidance for future progression.
```

## Notes

- Original genome is NEVER deleted, only backed up
- New genome should be realistic, not aspirational
- Focus on where story IS, not where you wish it was
- Honor organic character choices that led to divergence
- This is a course correction tool, not a railroad back to original plan
- Can be run multiple times as story continues to evolve

---

**Philosophy**: Stories evolve. Characters make unexpected choices. That's good writing. The genome should reflect reality and guide from there, not force compliance with an outdated plan.
