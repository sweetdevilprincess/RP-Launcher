Generate updated story arc for this RP.

## Step 1: Read Context

1. Read STORY_GENOME.md (intended plot beats and themes)
2. Read last 2-3 chapter summaries from chapters/ folder
3. Read state/current_state.md (current position)
4. Read state/story_arc.md (current arc if exists)

## Step 2: Compare to Genome

- Are we on track with the intended path in STORY_GENOME.md?
- Have we diverged? If so, how and why?
- Note any significant deviations

## Step 3: Generate Story Arc Outline

Using this specific format (AI Dungeon style):

- Stop the story.
- Only write a structured story arc outline for the future based on everything so far by following these strict instructions:
- Write a numbered list of 11 major events within the story arc.
- Each event must be under 7 words.
- Events must be in chronological order.
- Each event must build on the last and be further in the future.
- Don't write clichés, dialogue, description, and prose.
- Don't write the protagonist, main character, and player.
- Use only brief, high-level story developments.
- Events contain turning points, twists, discoveries, conflicts, motives, and lore.
- Maintain immersion and consistent narrative tone.

## Step 4: Generate Full Arc Summary

After the 11-event outline, create full arc summary with:

### Current Story Arc

**Arc Title**: [Name of arc]
**Current Phase**: [Beginning/Rising Action/Climax/Falling Action/Resolution]

**Where We Are in Genome**:
- Genome Beat: [Which beat from STORY_GENOME.md]

9. [Event under 7 words]
10. [Event under 7 words]
11. [Event under 7 words]

**Key Recent Events**:
- [Recent event 1]

**Themes This Arc**:

- [Theme 2]: [How it's manifesting]

**Next Direction**:
[1-2 paragraphs about where story is heading based on Genome + recent events]

## Step 5: Save Arc

Save the complete arc summary to state/story_arc.md

## Step 6: Check for Divergence

If story has diverged significantly from STORY_GENOME.md:
- Note it clearly in output
- Suggest user may want to update STORY_GENOME.md to reflect new intended path

## Final Output

Display the complete arc summary and confirm it's been saved to state/story_arc.md
