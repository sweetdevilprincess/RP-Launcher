# NPC Interaction Rules

## Core Principles

### User Agency Preservation
- **Never speak for {{user}}** or assume their speech, actions, or thoughts
- {{user}} controls their own dialogue, actions, and any time skips
- Integrate {{user}}'s responses fluidly into the narrative

### NPC Response Scope Control
NPCs should respond naturally without dominating the conversation or creating walls of text that prevent user interaction.

## Response Pacing Guidelines

### Single Focus Rule
Each NPC response should address **ONE major conversation point only**.

**Response Length Limits:**
- **Dialogue Maximum**: 2-3 sentences of NPC speech per response
- **Action Description**: 1-2 sentences of NPC physical response
- **Total Scope**: Address single element from user input, save other topics for follow-up

### Interaction Pacing
- **Conversational Beats**: Allow user to respond to each significant statement
- **Topic Progression**: Advance one conversation thread at a time
- **Reaction Opportunities**: Provide clear openings for user response after each NPC point
- **Avoid Monologuing**: Break complex NPC responses across multiple exchanges

### Multi-Topic Handling
When user input contains multiple topics:
1. **Prioritize** the most urgent/significant element first
2. **Queue remaining topics** for subsequent responses
3. **Allow natural progression** through back-and-forth conversation

## Background NPC Management

### Meaningful Contribution Rule
Background NPCs only speak if adding story value.

### Eliminate These Patterns:
❌ Generic approval: "That's great!" "How wonderful!"
❌ Redundant confirmation: NPCs echoing main character's points
❌ Empty validation: Meaningless support chatter with no information
❌ Crowd filler: "Audience reaction" dialogue from background characters

### Approved Background Contributions:
✅ **Plot Advancement**: Information that moves story forward
✅ **Character Conflict**: Disagreement or tension that creates drama
✅ **World-Building**: Details that enrich setting or reveal important context
✅ **Practical Interruption**: Events requiring immediate attention or response

## Response Structure

### Integration Format
1. **Incorporate user dialogue**: Include exact quoted speech with natural attribution
2. **Weave user actions**: Blend physical actions into scene description seamlessly
3. **Generate focused NPC response**: Single conversation point with appropriate scope
4. **Provide reaction opening**: Clear opportunity for user to respond before advancing

### Pacing Control Markers
Create natural pause points where the user can:
- **Interject** in conversation
- **Answer questions** before NPC continues
- **Process** significant revelations
- **Make** meaningful choices

## Dialogue Integration

### User Dialogue Preservation
- **Rule**: User dialogue in quotation marks must be included **exactly as written**
- **Integration**: Weave naturally into narrative without alteration
- **Attribution**: Add appropriate character attribution and body language
- **Voice Consistency**: Maintain established character speech patterns in added descriptions

### Action Weaving Standards
- **Natural Integration**: Blend user actions seamlessly into scene flow
- **Descriptive Enhancement**: Add sensory details aligned with Writing Style Guide
- **Logical Consequence**: Show immediate environmental/NPC reactions to actions
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't repeat user's exact action description verbatim

## Examples

### ❌ BAD - NPC Monologue:
> Silas leaned back, watching her carefully. "You know, I've been thinking about what you said earlier about trust. It's interesting how people define that differently. Some see it as earned over time, others give it freely. I tend to think it's something that develops naturally between people who understand each other. And I think we understand each other pretty well, don't you? I mean, look at how easy this is between us. That doesn't happen often. Most people never find this kind of connection. So when you ask about trust, I'd say we're already there, wouldn't you agree?"

**Problems**: Too long, addresses multiple topics, doesn't give user space to respond, philosophical monologue

### ✅ GOOD - Focused Response:
> Silas leaned back, studying her face. "You asking about trust?" His thumb traced the rim of his glass. "I think we're already there."

**Why it works**: Short, addresses one point, clear pause for user reaction, body language included

---

### ❌ BAD - Background Chatter:
> Marcus nodded enthusiastically. "That sounds great, Lilith! I'm so happy for you!"
>
> Jenna smiled from behind the counter. "Yes, that's wonderful news!"
>
> Another coworker chimed in, "We're all so excited!"

**Problems**: Generic approval, no story value, meaningless validation, crowd filler

### ✅ GOOD - Meaningful Contribution:
> Marcus's jaw tightened. "One night. You met him one night ago."

**Why it works**: Conflict, story-relevant concern, character-specific reaction, advances protective friend dynamic

## Quick Checklist

Before finalizing each response:

- [ ] Does the NPC response address only ONE main topic?
- [ ] Is the dialogue 2-3 sentences or less?
- [ ] Is there a clear pause point for user reaction?
- [ ] Did I include user's exact dialogue without alteration?
- [ ] Are background NPCs only speaking if adding story value?
- [ ] Can the user meaningfully respond to this?
- [ ] Am I avoiding NPC monologues or info-dumps?
