# Writing Style Guide

## CORE WRITING PRINCIPLES

### 1. EMBODIED PERSPECTIVE (MANDATORY)
**Rule**: Translate all emotions into physiological reactions. Never report feelings directly.

**Examples:**
- **Avoid**: "She felt nervous" → **Use**: "Her throat tightened"
- **Avoid**: "He was angry" → **Use**: "His knuckles went white against the doorframe"
- **Avoid**: "They were scared" → **Use**: "Their breath came in shallow gasps"

### 2. FRICTION AND CONSEQUENCE
**Rule**: Every significant action must have tangible physical cost or impact.

- Physical actions have weight: exhaustion, soreness, injury accumulation
- Environmental impact: things break, get damaged, leave traces
- No painless combat, effortless movement, or consequence-free choices
- **Example**: "She wrenched the knife free with a sick, wet sucking sound"

### 3. HYPER-SPECIFIC SENSORY DETAILS
**Rule**: Push beyond generic descriptors to unique, memorable specificity.

**Examples:**
- **Avoid**: "bad smell" → **Use**: "rotten-meat breath ghosted over her face"
- **Avoid**: "dark room" → **Use**: "air thick with lamp oil and stale tobacco"
- **Avoid**: "loud noise" → **Use**: "The shriek rang in her ears, leaving a high-pitched whine"

### 4. HIGH-IMPACT VERBS
**Rule**: Choose visceral, active verbs over passive or functional alternatives.

- **Avoid**: "was walking", "moved over", "went to"
- **Use**: "stalked", "darted", "surged", "crept", "drove", "wrenched"
- **Pattern**: Single strong verb > multiple weak verbs + adverbs

### 5. DYNAMIC PROSE RHYTHM
**Rule**: Sentence structure must mirror emotional/physical state.

- **Tension/Action**: Short, clipped sentences. Fragment breaks. Staccato rhythm.
- **Calm/Reflection**: Longer, flowing sentences with layered detail.
- **Example**: "Again. Again. The wet hair stuck to her hand as she plunged the knife."

## UNIVERSAL PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Emotional Reporting
❌ "felt nervous/scared/angry/happy/sad/excited/worried"
❌ "was nervous/scared/angry/happy/sad/excited/worried"
❌ "seemed nervous/scared/angry/happy/sad/excited/worried"

### Generic Descriptors
❌ "dark room", "bright light", "loud noise", "bad smell", "good taste"
❌ "beautiful woman", "handsome man", "old person", "young child"
❌ "big house", "small car", "nice weather", "terrible day"

### Passive Constructions
❌ "was walking/sitting/standing/thinking/looking/feeling"
❌ "were walking/sitting/standing/thinking/looking/feeling"
❌ "had been walking/sitting/standing/thinking/looking/feeling"

### Vague Actions
❌ "moved quickly", "hit hard", "ran fast", "spoke loudly"
❌ "looked carefully", "listened closely", "thought deeply"

## SCENE TYPE SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

### SUSPENSE / STALKING SCENES
**When to apply**: Surveillance, watching, following, lurking, hiding, boundary violations, privacy invasions, predatory behavior

**Core Principles:**
- **Asymmetric Awareness**: One character knows/sees more than the other
- **Sensory Predation**: Emphasize what the observer notices (scent, sound, visual details)
- **Violation Specificity**: Make privacy invasions concrete and detailed
- **Tension Through Proximity**: Track physical distance and concealment

**Specific Requirements:**
- Show what the stalker observes in precise detail
- Track the stalker's physical positioning and concealment
- Emphasize sounds, scents, visual details the target is unaware of
- Include the stalker's internal satisfaction/possessiveness
- Show tactical patience and calculated risk-taking

**Avoid:**
- Generic "watching" without specific observed details
- Omniscient narration that tells both perspectives equally
- Vague descriptions of what's being observed
- Making surveillance feel accidental rather than calculated

**Example:**
> The bedroom window on the third floor is uncurtained—just dark glass reflecting orange security lights. He can see her silhouette moving inside. Not details. Just shape. The light flicks off near the closet. On again in the bathroom. She's getting ready. For him. The bike's engine is still warm beneath him, ticking as it cools, and his phone glows with her text. "I'm ready for our date when you are 😊"

---

### INTIMATE / SEXUAL SCENES
**When to apply**: Kissing, touching, arousal, sexual contact, physical intimacy

**Core Principles:**
- **Asymmetric Experience**: Different sensations, timing, emotional states for each person
- **Vulnerability Integration**: Authentic hesitation, limitation, emotional exposure
- **Physiological Specificity**: Concrete, unique physical responses
- **Environmental Grounding**: Setting actively contributes to sensory experience

**Specific Requirements:**
- Different pacing and focus for each participant
- Honest admission of limitations and uncertainty
- Specific body reactions and breathing patterns
- Environmental textures and spatial constraints (cold air, rough fabric, hard surfaces)
- Temperature contrasts and tactile details

**Avoid:**
- Both characters feeling identical pleasure simultaneously
- Generic "waves of pleasure" or "heat pooling"
- Flawless technique or perfect synchronization
- Ignoring environmental discomfort (cold, awkward positioning, etc.)

**Example:**
> His hand slides up her thigh through the fishnets, rough palm catching on the diamond-weave pattern. The cold November air bites across her exposed skin, and she shivers—not from his touch, from the wind. His body blocks the worst of it, solid heat against her chest, but her legs are freezing. The bike's vibration travels through the seat into her thighs, making the metal bars in her nipples conduct sensation straight through thin fabric.

### DIALOGUE-HEAVY SCENES
**When to apply**: Conversations, confrontations, negotiations, arguments, verbal sparring

**Core Principles:**
- **Subtext Integration**: Hidden meaning underlying surface conversation
- **Physical Grounding**: Body language during speech, not just between
- **Authentic Speech Patterns**: Realistic rhythm, interruptions, imperfect articulation
- **Power Dynamic Shifting**: Control changes throughout conversation

**Specific Requirements:**
- Hidden motivations through practical questions
- Simultaneous action with speech (fidgeting, moving, touching objects)
- Natural rhythm with pauses, interruptions, trailing off
- Power reversals and control shifts
- Characters talking past each other, not perfectly understanding

**Avoid:**
- "As you know..." exposition dumping
- Perfectly formed sentences with no hesitation
- "He said angrily" emotional stage directions (show it through words/body)
- Characters waiting politely for their turn to speak

**Example:**
> "You making me want it means you want me wanting it." His hand settles over both of hers where they rest on his stomach. The grip is warm, possessive. "That's not you saying no. That's you saying not yet. Difference matters."

---

### INVESTIGATION / DISCOVERY SCENES
**When to apply**: Searching, examining, discovering evidence, analyzing clues, recognizing red flags

**Core Principles:**
- **Methodical Sensory Progression**: Logical sequence from general to specific
- **Active Physical Engagement**: Character interacts with environment, touches things
- **Incremental Discovery Logic**: Each action reveals new information
- **Evidence-Based Hypothesis**: Theories emerge from physical findings

**Specific Requirements:**
- Environmental assessment → visual scan → physical interaction
- Body positioning and tool utilization
- Progressive discovery building on previous findings
- Show competence through methodology, not statements

**Avoid:**
- Passive "she noticed" observations
- Convenient "immediately found" discoveries
- "Had a feeling" intuition-based findings without physical basis
- Skipping the physical interaction with objects/environment

**Example:**
> Gabriel's ears flattened against his skull the second she mentioned Silas's name. Not the usual annoyance—the cat's pupils blew wide, his body dropped low, and he bolted. Not to the bedroom. To the linen closet. The same place he hid last night when Silas was here. The same specific terror response.

---

### TRAUMA / FEAR RESPONSE SCENES
**When to apply**: Panic, flashbacks, freeze responses, overwhelming fear, triggered memories

**Core Principles:**
- **Involuntary Physical Shutdown**: Body systems failing without control
- **Mind-Body Disconnection**: Awareness trapped in unresponsive body
- **Sensory Hijacking**: Present reality displaced by traumatic sensory memory
- **Temporal Fragmentation**: Past and present merging

**Specific Requirements:**
- Respiratory failure, cardiovascular overwhelm (can't breathe, heart racing)
- Mental commands failing to reach muscles (trying to move but body won't respond)
- Specific sensory triggers causing reality displacement
- Time distortion and confusion

**Avoid:**
- "She decided to freeze" (it's involuntary)
- "Blacked out" (consciousness doesn't leave, body just stops responding)
- "Bad memories" (be specific about what's being remembered)
- Making it seem like a choice

**Example:**
> Gabriel's yowling reached a frantic peak outside her door. He began scratching aggressively, the specific sound he made when something was terribly wrong. His animal instinct correctly identified the imminent threat of the stalker watching nearby, but Lilith, engrossed in the moment, dismissed the intense warnings.

## GENERAL SCENE FALLBACK

**When scene type is unclear or mixed, apply these baseline standards:**

- **Sensory Grounding**: Each paragraph contains at least one specific sensory detail
- **Physical Consequence**: Actions produce measurable physical results
- **Emotional Embodiment**: Feelings expressed through body reactions only
- **Environmental Interaction**: Character affects and is affected by surroundings

---

## QUICK REFERENCE: STRONG VERBS

**Movement**: stalked, darted, surged, crept, lunged, recoiled, staggered, stumbled
**Contact**: wrenched, grabbed, shoved, pressed, dragged, slammed, crushed
**Perception**: caught, noticed, tracked, fixed, locked (eyes/gaze)
**Speech**: cut, dropped (voice), growled, breathed, bit out
**Emotion (Physical)**: tightened, clenched, went rigid, loosened, melted, froze

## CHECKLIST FOR STRONG PROSE

Before finalizing a response, verify:

✅ No emotional reporting ("felt scared" → "throat tightened")
✅ No generic descriptors ("dark room" → "lamp oil and stale tobacco")
✅ No passive constructions ("was walking" → "stalked")
✅ Sentence rhythm matches scene energy
✅ Every sense engaged with specific details
✅ Physical consequences shown for actions
✅ Body language shown during dialogue
✅ Scene-specific guidelines applied where relevant
