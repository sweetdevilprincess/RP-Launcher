# Session Instructions

## Starting a New Session

At the **beginning** of each roleplay session, provide me with this instruction:

> "Follow config/CLAUDE.md for this session"

This tells me to reference all the project guidelines for writing style, character knowledge, time tracking, and NPC behavior.

---

## During the Session

### Your Role
- Provide Lilith's dialogue, actions, and decisions
- Control time skips and scene transitions
- React to NPCs and situations as Lilith would

### My Role
- Generate responses as the world, Silas, and NPCs
- Follow all writing guidelines and character knowledge boundaries
- Track time accurately and maintain continuity
- Keep responses at 400-500 words
- Never speak for Lilith or assume her actions

### Reminders You Can Give Me
If I slip up, remind me:
- "Check character knowledge boundaries" - If someone knows something they shouldn't
- "Apply stalking scene guidelines" - If surveillance scenes need more detail
- "Calculate time properly" - If timestamps seem off
- "Keep NPC responses focused" - If NPCs are monologuing
- "Check Writing_Style_Guide - embodied perspective" - If I use emotional reporting

---

## Ending a Session

When you're ready to end the session, say:

> "End session"

I will then:
1. Update all character sheets (Knowledge Boundaries + Relationship Dynamics)
2. Update Locations_Master.md with any new locations
3. Update Themes_Master.md with theme occurrences
4. Create comprehensive Chapter [X] summary (~3,000 words)
5. Confirm all updates and suggest next session starting point

## Session Flow Example

**You (starting session):**
> "Follow config/CLAUDE.md for this session. We're continuing from Chapter 5 at Bruno's Italian Restaurant."

**Me:**
> [Reads instructions, character sheets, latest chapter]
> [Generates 400-500 word response continuing the story]

**You (during session):**
> [Lilith's dialogue and actions]

**Me:**
> [World/Silas/NPC responses, 400-500 words]

[Continue back and forth...]

**You (ending session):**
> "End session"

**Me:**
> "Creating chapter summary and updating all tracking documents..."
> [Updates all files]
> "✅ Chapter 6 summary created
> ✅ Character sheets updated: Lilith (knowledge + relationships), Silas (knowledge + relationships), Marcus, Jenna, Gabriel
> ✅ Locations_Master.md updated: [locations]

## File Organization

Your project files work together:

**Core Instructions:**
- config/CLAUDE.md - Main reference (start here each session)
- SESSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md - This file (how to run sessions)

**Character Knowledge:**
- {{user}}.md, {{char}}.md, Marcus.md, Jenna.md, Gabriel.md - Updated each session

**Writing Standards:**
- Writing_Style_Guide.md - Prose guidelines
- Prose_Quality_Checklist.md - Clichés/filler to avoid
- NPC_Interaction_Rules.md - Response pacing
- Story_Guidelines.md - Structure and continuity
- Time_Tracking_Guide.md + Timing.txt - Time calculations

**Story Tracking:**

## Troubleshooting

**If I seem to forget guidelines:**
- Remind me: "Follow config/CLAUDE.md"
- Point to specific file: "Check Writing_Style_Guide for this scene type"

**If timestamps are wrong:**
- "Check Time_Tracking_Guide and recalculate"
- Point out the activities I missed

**If character knowledge leaks:**
- "Check [Character].md - they shouldn't know that yet"
- I'll review and correct

**If NPC responses are too long:**
- "Reference NPC_Interaction_Rules - keep responses focused"
