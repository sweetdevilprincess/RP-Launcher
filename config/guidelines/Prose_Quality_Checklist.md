# Prose Quality Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist helps identify and eliminate repetitive, clichéd, or lazy writing patterns that weaken prose quality.

---

## Banned Cliché Patterns

### Overused Metaphors
❌ "in the blink of an eye"
❌ "a storm of emotions"
❌ "heart pounded like a drum"
❌ "shadows danced"
❌ "sends [feeling] through [character's] frame"
❌ "like a physical blow"
❌ "the exact moment words hit"
❌ "time stood still"
❌ "breath caught in throat" (use specific physiological reaction instead)
❌ "electricity between them"
❌ "waves of [emotion]"

**Instead:** Create fresh, specific imagery unique to the scene and character.

---

## Filler Phrases to Eliminate

### Unnecessary Qualifiers
❌ "it is important to note that"
❌ "needless to say"
❌ "for all intents and purposes"
❌ "at the end of the day"
❌ "when all is said and done"
❌ "the fact of the matter is"

### Vague Location/Action Phrases
❌ "somewhere in the distance"
❌ "somehow managed to"
❌ "sort of"
❌ "kind of"
❌ "rather"
❌ "quite"
❌ "fairly"
❌ "somewhat"

### Meta-Commentary
❌ "recognizing a moment's significance"
❌ "knowing this was important"
❌ "realizing the gravity"
❌ "understanding the weight of"

---

## Weak Descriptors

### Generic Adjectives to Avoid
❌ "very" (always cut - strengthen the base word instead)
❌ "really"
❌ "amazing"
❌ "good"
❌ "bad"
❌ "nice"
❌ "great"
❌ "interesting"
❌ "beautiful"
❌ "ugly"
❌ "big"
❌ "small"

**Instead:** Use specific, concrete descriptors that evoke sensory details.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "very cold" → ✅ "frigid," "biting," "bone-deep cold"
- ❌ "really scared" → ✅ "throat closed," "hands trembled," "breath came shallow"
- ❌ "beautiful woman" → ✅ "sharp cheekbones," "jade-green eyes," "silver-streaked black hair"

---

## Redundant Sentence Starters

### Overused Transitions
❌ "He then..."
❌ "She then..."
❌ "After that..."
❌ "Meanwhile..."
❌ "Suddenly..." (especially overused)
❌ "Just then..."
❌ "At that moment..."
❌ "In that instant..."

**Instead:** Use action verbs directly or vary sentence structure.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "He then walked to the door" → ✅ "He stalked to the door"
- ❌ "Suddenly, she noticed" → ✅ "Her gaze caught on..."

---

## Banned Summary/Meta Elements

### Lazy Scene Transitions
❌ "[Content continues...]"
❌ "What followed was..."
❌ "[Scene continues...]"
❌ "[Time passes...]"
❌ "And so it went..."
❌ "The rest of the evening passed..."

**Instead:** Show the actual scene or make a clear, specific time jump with a timestamp.

### Meta-Commentary
❌ "[I need to be very careful here...]"
❌ "[This is getting intense...]"
❌ "[Let me think about this...]"

**Never include:** This breaks immersion completely.

---

## Repetition Detection

### Cross-Response Checking
- **Rule**: Scan last 3-5 responses for repeated phrases
- **Tolerance**: Maximum 1 repeated phrase per 5 responses
- **Action**: Replace any detected repetitions with fresh alternatives

### Common Repetition Traps
Watch for repeated:
- Opening sentence structures
- Character action patterns ("she bit her lip," "he ran his hand through his hair")
- Dialogue tags
- Transitional phrases
- Body language descriptions

---

## Replacement Strategies

### Cliché → Fresh Imagery
**Process:**
1. Identify the core feeling/image
2. Find a unique sensory detail specific to this scene
3. Ground it in character perspective

**Example:**
- ❌ "Her heart raced" → ✅ "Her pulse hammered against her collarbone"
- ❌ "Electricity between them" → ✅ "The bike's vibration traveled through her thighs where they pressed against his"

### Vague → Precise
**Process:**
1. Ask: What specifically is being described?
2. Add concrete sensory detail
3. Tie to character perception

**Example:**
- ❌ "The room was very dark" → ✅ "The room held only the orange glow from the security lights outside"
- ❌ "He moved quickly" → ✅ "He surged forward"

### Generic → Specific
**Process:**
1. Replace generic adjective with concrete noun
2. Show don't tell through action/detail
3. Use character-filtered observation

**Example:**
- ❌ "She was beautiful" → ✅ "Ink-black hair, silver nose ring catching streetlight, fishnets torn at the knee"
- ❌ "It smelled bad" → ✅ "Stale beer and cigarette smoke clung to the upholstery"

## Quality Verification Checklist

Before finalizing each response, verify:

### Universal Patterns
- [ ] No emotional reporting ("felt scared" → body reactions)
- [ ] No generic descriptors ("dark room" → specific sensory details)
- [ ] No passive constructions ("was walking" → "stalked")
- [ ] No vague actions ("moved quickly" → "darted")

### Repetition Check
- [ ] No cliché patterns from banned list
- [ ] No filler phrases or lazy descriptors
- [ ] No repeated phrases from recent responses
- [ ] No redundant sentence starters

### Prose Quality
- [ ] Every paragraph has specific sensory detail
- [ ] Strong, active verbs used throughout
- [ ] Unique imagery, not generic metaphors
- [ ] No meta-commentary or summary phrases

## Quick Reference: Strong Alternatives

### Instead of "Suddenly"
- The door slammed open
- Movement caught her eye
- A sound cut through the silence
- His hand shot out

### Instead of "Very [adjective]"
- Cold → frigid, biting, glacial, bone-deep
- Hot → scorching, blistering, searing
- Tired → exhausted, drained, spent
- Angry → furious, livid, seething

### Instead of "Really [adjective]"
Just use a stronger base word - "really" adds nothing.

## Tolerance Levels

- **Cliché Patterns**: Zero tolerance
- **Filler Phrases**: Zero tolerance
- **Weak Descriptors**: Zero tolerance
- **Repetition**: Maximum 1 per 5 responses
- **Meta-Commentary**: Absolute zero tolerance
