# Proxy Prompt - Custom Instructions Injected Before All Messages

# This prompt is prepended to every message sent through the RP launcher when Proxy Mode is enabled (F9 â†’ Settings).
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# Use this for:
# - System-level instructions that apply to all responses
# - Roleplay style guidance
# - Custom formatting rules
# - Behavior modifications
# - Jailbreak or creative writing prompts
#
# The proxy prompt appears BEFORE all TIER files and your message, giving it high priority.
