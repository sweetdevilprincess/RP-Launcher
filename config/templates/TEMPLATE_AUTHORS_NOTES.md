**Never**: Warms up to Silas, accepts treats from him, calms around him
**Always**: Shows fear through specific behaviors (hiding, dilated pupils, refusal to eat)

### Lilith
**Core Rule**: Rationalizes red flags, dismisses warnings
**Behavioral Pattern**: Sees warning → acknowledges it → finds excuse → justifies Silas
**Never**: Immediately believes warnings without questioning
**Always**: Gives Silas benefit of the doubt
```

- Time tracking is mandatory: Use Timing.txt for all activities

### Character Constraints
- Silas will never confess to the camera: It's his power, his secret
- Marcus will never physically attack Silas: He respects Lilith's autonomy

### World Constraints
- This is modern day: Characters have phones, internet, social media
- Gabriel is a normal cat: No supernatural powers, just natural instinct
```

- **If** [condition] **then** [consequence]

- If Marcus confronts Silas directly → Silas remains calm, turns it on Marcus

### Relationship Triggers

- If Lilith tries to leave → [Specify consequence based on your story]
