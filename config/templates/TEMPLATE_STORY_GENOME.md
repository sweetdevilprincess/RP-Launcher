## Character Arcs (Intended Trajectories)

### [Character Name]
**Starting Point**: [Who they are at story start]
**Core Wound/Need**: [What drives their choices]
**Arc Type**: [Growth / Fall / Flat / Complex]

**Intended Progression:**
1. **Phase 1**: [Early arc - what they believe/how they act]

**Core Wound/Need**: Loneliness from family estrangement, needs to be seen/known
**Arc Type**: Tragic awakening (innocence → awareness → choice)

**Intended Progression:**
1. **Innocence**: Believes in meet-cute, trusts feelings, dismisses red flags
2. **Cognitive Dissonance**: Knows and denies simultaneously, rationalization peaks
3. **Awakening**: Can no longer deny reality, forced to see clearly
4. **Choice**: [Does she choose safety, love, revenge, acceptance?]

**What it is**: [Describe the recurring pattern]
**Why it repeats**: [Thematic/character reason]
**How it escalates**: [How pattern intensifies]
**When it breaks**: [Intended breaking point]

**Example:**
```
### Red Flag Rationalization Cycle

- **Middle**: Lilith senses imbalance but can't identify source (confusion)
- **Late**: Full reveal of imbalance (stalking, camera, months of lies)
- **Endpoint**: [Does power equalize? Does she seize it? Does it crush her?]

## Key Story Mechanics (How This Story Works)

### Perspective & POV
**POV**: [Whose perspective / narrative style]
**Reader Knowledge**: [What reader knows that characters don't]
**Dramatic Irony**: [How information gap creates tension]

### Pacing & Structure
**Overall Pacing**: [Slow burn / Fast-paced / Variable]
**Act Structure**: [3-act / 5-act / Other]
**Escalation Model**: [How tension builds - gradual? Sudden? Cyclical?]

### Revelation Strategy
**How Information is Revealed**:
- **To Reader**: [How/when reader learns secrets]
- **To Characters**: [How/when characters learn]
- **Dramatic Irony**: [How gap between them creates tension]

**Example:**
```
### Perspective & POV
**POV**: Exclusively Lilith's (embodied, limited knowledge)
**Reader Knowledge**: Sees Silas's actions when Lilith isn't present
**Dramatic Irony**: Reader knows months of stalking, camera, full obsession; Lilith discovers gradually

### Pacing & Structure
**Overall Pacing**: Slow burn escalation (boundaries erode gradually, not suddenly)
**Act Structure**: 4 acts (Innocence / Falling / Trapped / Crisis)
**Escalation Model**: Exponential - each boundary crossed makes next easier/bigger

### Revelation Strategy
**To Reader**: Show everything from start (full dramatic irony)
**To Characters**: Lilith discovers in stages (following → stalking → camera → full extent)
**Dramatic Irony**: Reader dread builds as Lilith remains unaware; payoff when she catches up
```

### [Date] - Divergence: [What Changed]

**Why It Diverged**:

**New Intended Path**:
- Silas escalates surveillance (can't lose control)
- Lilith tries to maintain boundaries while still seeing him
- New climax: Silas's reaction to loss of control (violence? Manipulation? Revelation?)
