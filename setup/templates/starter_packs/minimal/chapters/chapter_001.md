# Chapter 1

<!--
=============================================================================
WELCOME! This is your first chapter file.

You have two options:

1. START FRESH: Just start writing below! You can write your opening scene
   directly in the TUI when you launch. This file can stay empty.

2. PRE-WRITE: Write your opening scene here before launching, then continue
   in the TUI.

Delete these comments when you're ready!

OPTIONAL: Writing Tips (delete if you don't need them)
-------------------------------------------------------

Your opening chapter should establish:
  • Setting - Where are we?
  • Your Character - Who is {{user}} and what are they doing?
  • Atmosphere - What's the mood and tone?
  • Hook - What draws us into the story?

Example Opening (Fantasy Adventure):
--------------------------------------
The tavern stank of spilled ale and desperation.

I nursed my drink in the corner, trying to ignore the off-key singing
from the bard's corner. Three days in this backwater town, and still
no word from the guild. My coin purse grew lighter by the hour, and
my patience along with it.

That's when she walked in.

Tall, cloaked, moving with the kind of confidence that meant either
wealth or power—possibly both. She scanned the room once, and her
eyes locked on mine.

Great. Just great.

Why this works:
  ✓ Establishes setting (tavern in a small town)
  ✓ Shows character's situation (broke, waiting for work)
  ✓ Sets tone (somewhat cynical but engaged)
  ✓ Introduces a hook (mysterious woman)

Quick Tips:
-----------
• Start in the middle of something (not waking up!)
• Show, don't tell ("My hand trembled" not "I was nervous")
• Leave room for Claude to respond
• Be specific with details
