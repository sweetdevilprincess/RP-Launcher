## Generation Guidelines for Claude

When creating new characters, places, or entities:

1. **Check existing names** - Avoid duplicating names unless intentional (e.g., family naming traditions)
2. **Match the culture** - Use the appropriate naming pattern for the character's origin
3. **Consider social class** - Names might differ between nobility and commoners
4. **Be consistent** - Once a pattern is established, stick to it
5. **Make names memorable** - Avoid overly complex names for minor characters
6. **Avoid modern names** - Unless setting is modern or there's a specific reason
