## Generation Guidelines for Claude

When creating new characters, places, or entities:

1. **Check existing names** - Avoid duplicates unless intentional (e.g., family naming traditions)
2. **Match the culture** - Use appropriate naming patterns for the character's origin
3. **Consider social class** - Peasants vs. nobles have different naming conventions
4. **Be consistent** - Once a pattern is established, stick to it
5. **Make names memorable** - Avoid overly complex names for minor characters
6. **Context matters** - Formal vs. informal settings affect how names are used
7. **Respect traditions** - Ancient races may have naming customs to honor
