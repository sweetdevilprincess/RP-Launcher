## Opening Scene

(This is where your story begins. Below are some prompts to help you get started, or write your own opening.)

### Setting the Scene

Where does your story begin? Choose a starting point:

**Option 1: Humble Beginning**
> Your character is in an ordinary place living an ordinary life when something unexpected happens—a stranger arrives, a crisis emerges, or a call reaches you.

**Option 2: Already in Progress**
> Your character is already adventuring, traveling through the world. This chapter begins mid-journey.

**Option 3: The Moment of Change**
> Your character is at a crossroads—forced or choosing to leave behind their old life and embrace a new path.

**Option 4: A Mystery Unfolds**
> Your character discovers something strange, receives a cryptic message, or stumbles upon an opportunity that changes everything.

## Tips for Starting Strong

1. **Paint a picture** - Describe the location vividly. What do you see, hear, smell?
2. **Introduce yourself** - Show who your character is through their actions and thoughts
3. **Create tension** - Even a quiet opening should have something compelling happening
4. **Be specific** - "A tavern" is less interesting than "The Prancing Pony at dusk, crowded with rough traders"
5. **Leave room for adventure** - Don't resolve everything in the opening, let the story unfold
