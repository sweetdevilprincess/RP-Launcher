## Using the Template Files

### AUTHOR'S_NOTES.md
This file contains your **absolute story rules**. Claude will follow these religiously:
- What MUST happen in your story
- What MUST NOT happen
- Your writing style preferences
- Character guidelines

**Fill this out first** - it guides everything Claude does.

### STORY_GENOME.md
Your **story roadmap** (flexible):
- Act structure and plot points
- Major themes
- Character arcs
- World-building details

This helps Claude understand the bigger picture while staying responsive to your choices.

### NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md
**Pre-filled with fantasy examples**, but customize for your world:
- Character naming patterns (for different cultures/races)
- Location naming patterns
- Organization names
- Legendary item names

Claude uses this to generate new NPCs and places that fit your world.

### SCENE_NOTES.md
**Update between sessions** to guide the current session:
- Where the story is right now
- Key NPCs in this scene
- Your session goals
- Important context to remember

---

## Character Sheets

### {{user}}.md - Your Character
- Your hero's name, appearance, personality
- Skills, equipment, motivations
- Background and relationships
- What drives your character forward

**Make this detailed** - Claude uses it to understand how to play alongside you.

### {{char}}.md - Your Main Companion
- The NPC Claude will play most often
- Their personality, motivations, history
- How they relate to your character
- Their own goals and conflicts

**This NPC should be a real character**, not just a helper. Give them depth!

## Fantasy Adventure Starting Ideas

### The Prophecy
A mysterious prophecy surrounds your character. They must uncover its meaning and decide whether to fulfill or defy it.

### The Quest
An NPC gives you a task: recover a stolen artifact, rescue someone, or reach a distant location. The journey reveals much larger stakes.

### The Curse
Your character, a companion, or the land itself is cursed. Breaking it requires adventure, sacrifice, and self-discovery.

### The Awakening
Your character discovers they have magical powers, are royalty, are the chosen one, or have a hidden destiny.

### The Escape
Your character flees from something (persecution, death, a terrible past) and must build a new life while being hunted.

### The Revenge
Someone wronged your character or their loved ones. The quest for justice becomes a journey of deeper understanding.

### The Mystery
An unsolved crime, disappearance, or dark secret draws your character into investigation that reveals shocking truths.
