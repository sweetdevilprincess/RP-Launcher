# RP Launcher - AI-Powered Roleplay Campaign Manager

**A sophisticated roleplay automation system that feels like having a DM/GM, not a chatbot.**

Built for long-form, persistent storytelling with intelligent continuity tracking, automated memory management, and context-aware responses.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Is This?

RP Launcher is a **terminal-based roleplay system** that combines Claude AI with intelligent automation to manage complex, multi-session campaigns. Unlike traditional chatbots, it:

- **Remembers everything** - Automatic memory extraction and retrieval
- **Tracks relationships** - Dynamic character relationship monitoring
- **Manages plot threads** - Active thread detection and resolution tracking
- **Maintains consistency** - Entity cards, world facts, and contradiction detection
- **Optimizes context** - Smart tier-based loading (54-96% token reduction)
- **Feels like a DM** - Campaign continuity, not conversation threads

## âœ¨ Key Features

### ðŸ¤– **10-Agent Automation System**
- **4 Immediate Agents** (pre-response, 3-5s): Entity analysis, fact extraction, memory retrieval, plot thread loading
- **6 Background Agents** (post-response, hidden): Memory creation, relationship tracking, plot detection, knowledge extraction, response analysis, contradiction detection

### ðŸ§  **Intelligent Memory System**
- Multi-dimensional memory indexing (characters, location, tone, timestamp, relationship impact)
- Semantic memory retrieval (2-5 most relevant memories per character)
- Automatic memory creation from significant moments
- 96% token reduction vs loading all memories

### ðŸ“Š **Campaign Management**
- Entity cards for characters, locations, organizations
- Relationship tracking with tier system (enemy â†’ stranger â†’ friend â†’ close friend)
- Plot thread lifecycle management (active â†’ critical â†’ resolved)
- World-building knowledge base with fact extraction
- Story arc generation and tracking

### âš¡ **Performance Optimization**
- Prompt caching (54-61% token savings)
- Tier-based entity loading (Tier 1: full, Tier 2: facts only, Tier 3: skip)
- Debounced file writes (50-80% I/O reduction)
- Parallel agent execution (ThreadPoolExecutor)
- Hidden background processing (completes while you type)

### ðŸŽ¨ **Rich Terminal Interface**
- Multi-line text input with Ctrl+Enter to send
- Real-time context display (chapter, time, location, characters)
- F-key overlays (character sheets, story arc, entities, settings)
- Progress tracking and status indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick access

## ðŸ¤” Why Does This Exist?
tldr: I hate the chatbot feel and I am sure other people to too.

**Problem:** Existing tools like SillyTavern are optimized for **chatbot interaction** - short conversations with character cards. They don't handle:
- Long-form campaigns (50+ sessions)
- Plot thread management
- Persistent world-building
- Campaign continuity across weeks/months
- DM/GM-style storytelling

**Solution:** RP Launcher is built from the ground up for **persistent campaign management** with:
- Automated continuity tracking
- Smart context management (only loads relevant info)
- Background analysis (doesn't slow you down)
- Multi-dimensional memory system
- Campaign-first architecture
