# RP Launcher - AI-Powered Roleplay Campaign Manager

**A sophisticated roleplay automation system that feels like having a DM/GM, not a chatbot.**

Built for long-form, persistent storytelling with intelligent continuity tracking, automated memory management, and context-aware responses.

---

## üéØ What Is This?

RP Launcher is a **terminal-based roleplay system** that combines Claude AI with intelligent automation to manage complex, multi-session campaigns. Unlike traditional chatbots, it:

- **Remembers everything** - Automatic memory extraction and retrieval
- **Tracks relationships** - Dynamic character relationship monitoring
- **Manages plot threads** - Active thread detection and resolution tracking
- **Maintains consistency** - Entity cards, world facts, and contradiction detection
- **Optimizes context** - Smart tier-based loading (54-96% token reduction)
- **Feels like a DM** - Campaign continuity, not conversation threads

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

### ü§ñ **10-Agent Automation System**
- **4 Immediate Agents** (pre-response, 3-5s): Entity analysis, fact extraction, memory retrieval, plot thread loading
- **6 Background Agents** (post-response, hidden): Memory creation, relationship tracking, plot detection, knowledge extraction, response analysis, contradiction detection

### üß† **Intelligent Memory System**
- Multi-dimensional memory indexing (characters, location, tone, timestamp, relationship impact)
- Semantic memory retrieval (2-5 most relevant memories per character)
- Automatic memory creation from significant moments
- 96% token reduction vs loading all memories

### üìä **Campaign Management**
- Entity cards for characters, locations, organizations
- Relationship tracking with tier system (enemy ‚Üí stranger ‚Üí friend ‚Üí close friend)
- Plot thread lifecycle management (active ‚Üí critical ‚Üí resolved)
- World-building knowledge base with fact extraction
- Story arc generation and tracking

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**
- Prompt caching (54-61% token savings)
- Tier-based entity loading (Tier 1: full, Tier 2: facts only, Tier 3: skip)
- Debounced file writes (50-80% I/O reduction)
- Parallel agent execution (ThreadPoolExecutor)
- Hidden background processing (completes while you type)

### üé® **Rich Terminal Interface**
- Multi-line text input with Ctrl+Enter to send
- Real-time context display (chapter, time, location, characters)
- F-key overlays (character sheets, story arc, entities, settings)
- Progress tracking and status indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick access

## ü§î Why Does This Exist?
tldr: I hate the chatbot feel and I am sure other people to too.

**Problem:** Existing tools like SillyTavern are optimized for **chatbot interaction** - short conversations with character cards. They don't handle:
- Long-form campaigns (50+ sessions)
- Plot thread management
- Persistent world-building
- Campaign continuity across weeks/months
- DM/GM-style storytelling

**Solution:** RP Launcher is built from the ground up for **persistent campaign management** with:
- Automated continuity tracking
- Smart context management (only loads relevant info)
- Background analysis (doesn't slow you down)
- Multi-dimensional memory system
- Campaign-first architecture

## üé® Example: Memory System in Action

**During Response 47:**
```
User: "I want to go to the Rose bar next week"
    ‚Üì
Entity Analysis Agent:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Detects: "Rose bar" (Tier 2 - mentioned but absent)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Extracts 5 key facts:
        ‚Ä¢ Location: Downtown, near Bruno's
        ‚Ä¢ Hours: Tue-Sat, 8pm-2am
        ‚Ä¢ Known for: Live jazz music
        ‚Ä¢ Owner: Marcus
        ‚Ä¢ Atmosphere: Upscale, dim lighting
    ‚Üì
Claude: "Oh, that's the one by Bruno's, right? 
         I heard they have great jazz on Thursdays."
    ‚Üì
Background Agents (after response):
    ‚îú‚îÄ Memory Creation: New memory for character about planning visit
    ‚îú‚îÄ Knowledge Extraction: Bar hours, location confirmed
    ‚îî‚îÄ Plot Thread: "Visit to Rose bar" added (low priority)
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
**Next session (Response 65):**
```
User: "We're at the Rose bar now"
    ‚Üì
Memory Extraction Agent:
    ‚îî‚îÄ Loads relevant memory: "Planning to visit Rose bar (Response 47)"
    ‚Üì
Entity Analysis Agent:
    ‚îî‚îÄ Rose bar now Tier 1 (scene participant) - full card loaded
    ‚Üì
Claude: "The dim lighting and soft jazz create exactly 
         the atmosphere you were hoping for when you 
         suggested this place two weeks ago..."
```

**Perfect continuity without manual tracking.**
=======
1. **Launcher** (`launch_rp_tui.py`) - Entry point and process manager
2. **TUI** (`rp_client_tui.py`) - User interface (Textual)
3. **Bridge** (`tui_bridge.py`) - Backend connecting TUI to Claude

### Two Operating Modes

**SDK Mode (Default)** - No API Key Required:
- Uses Claude Code SDK bridge (Node.js wrapper)
- High-performance streaming responses
- Perfect for local development
- No API key setup needed

**API Mode** - Direct Claude API:
- Direct Anthropic Claude API access
- Requires API key (set in F8 Settings)
- Full token visibility and control
- Automatic fallback to SDK if key unavailable

See [TUI Bridge Documentation](Working Guides/TUI_BRIDGE_DOCUMENTATION.md) for complete details on both modes.
