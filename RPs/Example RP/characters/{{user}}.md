### {{user}} Suspects (But Isn't Sure):

fulness" feels controlling

## Relationship Dynamics

### With Alex:
- **Chapter 1**: ~~Friendly roommates, comfortable, grateful for Alex's help~~
- **Chapter 2**: ~~Comfortable~~ → Uneasy, noticing possessiveness
- **Chapter 3 (Current)**: Suspicious, defensive, starting to feel trapped
- **Trajectory**: Moving toward confrontation and realization
- **{{user}}'s perception**: "Alex is nice but something feels wrong, maybe I'm the problem?"

### With Sarah:
- **Always**: Best friends since college, very close, trusts her judgment
- **Chapter 1**: Normal closeness, excited to tell her about new place
- **Chapter 2**: ~~Seeing her regularly~~ → Less contact (Alex's influence), defensive when she questions living situation
- **Chapter 3 (Current)**: Conflict between loyalty to Alex and listening to Sarah, starting to let Sarah in, considering her offer of help
- **Trajectory**: Sarah as reality anchor and lifeline
- **{{user}}'s perception**: "Sarah's my best friend but maybe she's overreacting... or is she?"

### With Other Friends:
- **Chapter 1**: Normal social life, regular contact
- **Chapter 2-3**: ~~Regular contact~~ → Drifted apart, missed events, stopped responding
- **Current status**: Isolated (doesn't fully realize it's intentional)
- **{{user}}'s perception**: "I've been busy with the move... wait, when did I last see anyone besides Sarah and Alex?"

## Goals & Motivations

### Current Goals:
1. **Immediate**: Figure out if concerns about Alex are valid or if they're overreacting
2. **Short-term**: Maintain living situation if possible (lease, finances, conflict-avoidance)
3. **Internal**: Trust their own instincts again
4. **Social**: Reconnect with friends (starting to realize importance)

### Fears:
- Being wrong about Alex (guilt for suspecting someone kind to them)
- Being right about Alex (implications are scary)
- Confrontation and conflict
- Starting over again (just moved in)
- Losing more friends

### Conflicting Desires:
- Want to trust Alex vs. growing distrust
- Want independence vs. feeling dependent
- Want to avoid conflict vs. need to address situation
- Want to believe best in people vs. protecting self

---

## Arc Progress

### Starting Point (Chapter 1):
Naive, trusting, optimistic about new living situation

### Current Position (Chapter 3):
Awakening - can't ignore red flags anymore, torn between defending Alex and listening to Sarah, cognitive dissonance building

### Intended Trajectory:
```
Naive → Uneasy → Suspicious → Aware → Escaping → Free & Healing
       (Ch 1)  (Ch 2)  (Ch 3)   (Ch 5)   (Ch 6)
```

### Key Remaining Beats:
- Accept that concerns are valid (soon)
- Discover cameras/full extent (Chapter 5-6)
- Choose to leave (Chapter 5-6)
- Actually leave with Sarah's help (Chapter 6)
- Process and heal (Resolution)

---

## Physical/Environmental Details

### Belongings in Apartment:
- ~~Personal space clearly defined~~ → Pushed to edges of apartment
- Bedroom is only fully "theirs" space left
- Less comfortable having friends over (Alex always there)
- Moving boxes still unpacked (never fully settled in)

### Daily Routine:
- Works from home (gives Alex access during day)
- ~~Used to go out often~~ → Staying in more (Alex's influence)
- ~~Regular coffee dates with Sarah~~ → Less frequent
- Gym/hobbies → ~~Regular~~ → Sporadic (Alex monopolizes time)

---

## Memory & Recall

### Sharp Memories:
- Finding Alex going through belongings (recent, undeniable)
- Sarah's birthday dinner they missed (guilt)
- Alex's face when caught (the mask slip)
- Specific times friends reached out and they didn't respond

### Fuzzy Memories:
- Exact timeline of when isolation started (gradual, hard to pinpoint)
- Small early red flags (rationalized away immediately)
- How many times Alex "coincidentally" knew their plans

### Forgotten Details:
- Minor daily boundary crossings (normalized)
- Early conversations where Alex gathered information
- First times friends stopped reaching out (didn't notice)

## Behavioral Notes for RP

### How {{user}} Responds To:

**Red flags**:
- Immediate reaction: Notice something's wrong
- Secondary reaction: Rationalize ("Maybe I'm overthinking")
- Building pattern: Harder to rationalize each time

**Sarah's concerns**:
- Initial: Defensive ("You don't understand")
- Developing: Conflicted ("Maybe you have a point...")
- Current: Starting to listen ("Tell me what you see")

**Alex's gaslighting**:
- Susceptible due to self-doubt
- But building resistance (catching contradictions)
- Starting to trust gut over Alex's explanations

**Confrontation**:
- Avoidant, tries to smooth over
- But reaching breaking point
- Will eventually stand ground (character growth)

---

## Notes for Maintaining Consistency

1. **{{user}} can only know what they've directly experienced**
   - No meta-knowledge about cameras
   - No awareness of intercepted messages unless discovered
   - No knowledge of Alex's internal thoughts/plans

2. **Gradual awakening, not sudden**
   - Each chapter, awareness increases slightly
   - Backslides into doubt are normal (gaslighting effect)
   - Full realization comes from undeniable evidence

3. **Internal conflict is key**
   - Want to trust Alex (they were kind)
   - Growing evidence says don't trust
   - This tension drives character arc

4. **Sarah as anchor**
   - When {{user}} doubts self, Sarah provides external reality
   - {{user}} trusts Sarah but struggles to accept her read
   - Eventually Sarah's persistence pays off

---

**{{user}}'s journey is about learning to trust their own instincts again after being systematically taught to doubt them.**
